# Perl Examples
This repository shows my understanding of different concepts of Perl with vivid examples.
This repository also aims to serve as a resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to enhance their understanding of Perl through practical examples.

## Technologies
* Perl

## How to use
Perl is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its text processing capabilities, rapid prototyping, and flexibility. 
If you do not have Perl, you can get it from [Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html)

1. Each file can be run without errors but the output may seem un-readble, So in each file codes are split into multiple blocks and each block is mostly independent of other.
2. You can comment and un-comment blocks as per your convinience.
3. Each file have seperate instructions for you in the form of codes.
4. Multiple examples are commented, so please un-comment accordinly.
5. I suggest you to start learning by going through files in order as some instructions given in the beginning are omitted for user-experience.

If you want to start working on your code right away, you might want to try the following commands:

From your command line:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/HimanthReddyGurram/Perl_Examples.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Perl_Examples.git

# Navigate to the specific folder of the file you want to run
# Run the app
# In the following command, replace file name with the name of your file, example: "perl example.pl"
perl <file name>

# If you are running/using .pm files then please run the following command after navigating into that folder.
# In the following command, replace file name with the name of your file, example: "perl -I ./ example.pl"
perl -I ./ <file name>
```
The output will be seen the terminal.
